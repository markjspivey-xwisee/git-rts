# Git-RTS Enhancement Plan: Decentralized Architecture & Advanced Git Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for enhancing Git-RTS with improved decentralization and more effective utilization of Git features for gameplay mechanics.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Current Git-RTS] --> B[Branch Project]
    B --> C[Implement P2P Architecture]
    B --> D[Add Git Hooks for Game Events]
    B --> E[Standardize Commit Messages]
    B --> F[Git-Based Conflict Resolution]
    B --> G[Distributed Validation]
    C & D & E & F & G --> H[Enhanced Git-RTS]
```

## 1. Project Branching & Setup

### Steps:
1. Create a new branch from the current master: `enhanced-p2p`
2. Set up development environment for the enhanced version
3. Update project documentation to reflect the new architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Git as Git Repository
    Dev->>Git: git checkout master
    Dev->>Git: git pull origin master
    Dev->>Git: git checkout -b enhanced-p2p
    Dev->>Git: git push -u origin enhanced-p2p
```

## 2. True Peer-to-Peer Architecture

### Current Architecture:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Central Repository] --> B[Player 1 Branch]
    A --> C[Player 2 Branch]
    A --> D[Player 3 Branch]
    B --> A
    C --> A
    D --> A
```

### Enhanced P2P Architecture:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Player 1 Repo] <--> B[Player 2 Repo]
    A <--> C[Player 3 Repo]
    B <--> C
    A --> D[Player 1 Game State]
    B --> E[Player 2 Game State]
    C --> F[Player 3 Game State]
```

### Implementation:
1. Modify the repository structure to support direct peer connections
   - Create a peers.json file to track other players' repositories
   - Implement remote management functions to add/remove peers

2. Update synchronization mechanism
   - Replace central pull/push with peer-to-peer fetch/merge operations
   - Implement a discovery mechanism for finding other players' repositories

3. Create a peer management interface
   - Add commands for adding/removing peers
   - Implement peer status checking

## 3. Git Hooks for Game Mechanics

### Implementation:
1. Create a hooks directory with template hooks
   - pre-commit: Validate game actions before committing
   - post-commit: Trigger game events after commit
   - pre-merge: Validate game state before merging
   - post-merge: Update game state after merging

2. Implement game event triggers
   - Resource discovery on commit
   - Random events based on commit patterns
   - Achievement unlocks based on commit history

3. Create a hook installation mechanism
   - Add a command to install/update hooks
   - Ensure hooks are synchronized across peers

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player as Player
    participant PreCommit as Pre-Commit Hook
    participant Git as Git Repository
    participant PostCommit as Post-Commit Hook
    
    Player->>PreCommit: Attempt game action
    PreCommit->>PreCommit: Validate action
    alt Valid Action
        PreCommit->>Git: Allow commit
        Git->>PostCommit: Trigger post-commit
        PostCommit->>PostCommit: Process game events
        PostCommit->>Player: Notify of outcomes
    else Invalid Action
        PreCommit->>Player: Reject with error
    end
```

## 4. Standardized Commit Message Conventions

### Implementation:
1. Define a structured commit message format
   ```
   [ACTION_TYPE] <entity_id>: <action_details>
   
   Location: {x: X, y: Y}
   Resources: {gold: G, wood: W, stone: S, food: F}
   Target: <target_entity_id>
   ```

2. Create commit message templates for different action types
   - MOVE: Unit movement
   - GATHER: Resource gathering
   - BUILD: Construction
   - TRAIN: Unit training
   - RESEARCH: Technology research
   - ATTACK: Combat actions

3. Implement a commit message parser
   - Extract action data from commit messages
   - Use for game state reconstruction
   - Enable game log generation from Git history

## 5. Git-Based Conflict Resolution Mechanics

### Implementation:
1. Define conflict scenarios in game terms
   - Territory control conflicts
   - Resource competition
   - Unit positioning conflicts

2. Create conflict resolution rules
   - Deterministic resolution based on unit stats
   - Resource splitting algorithms
   - Territory control mechanics

3. Implement merge strategies
   - Custom merge drivers for different game entities
   - Conflict resolution that produces game events
   - History-aware merging that considers past actions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Git Merge Conflict] --> B{Conflict Type}
    B -->|Territory| C[Territory Resolution]
    B -->|Resource| D[Resource Resolution]
    B -->|Unit Position| E[Combat Resolution]
    C --> F[Update Game State]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Generate Game Event]
    G --> H[Complete Merge]
```

## 6. Distributed Validation

### Implementation:
1. Create a rule validation system
   - Define game rules in a machine-readable format
   - Implement validators for different action types
   - Create test cases for validation

2. Implement consensus mechanisms
   - Require multiple peers to validate major actions
   - Create a validation chain in commit history
   - Implement reputation system for validators

3. Add cryptographic verification
   - Sign game actions with player keys
   - Verify signatures during synchronization
   - Prevent tampering with game history

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P1 as Player 1
    participant P2 as Player 2
    participant P3 as Player 3
    
    P1->>P1: Perform action
    P1->>P1: Local validation
    P1->>P1: Commit with signature
    P1->>P2: Sync
    P1->>P3: Sync
    
    P2->>P2: Validate P1's action
    P3->>P3: Validate P1's action
    
    alt Valid Action
        P2->>P2: Add validation signature
        P3->>P3: Add validation signature
        P2->>P1: Confirm validation
        P3->>P1: Confirm validation
        P1->>P1: Action confirmed
    else Invalid Action
        P2->>P1: Reject action
        P3->>P1: Reject action
        P1->>P1: Revert action
    end
```
